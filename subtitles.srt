Space Invasion 2-1 is a simple game
about you shooting alien invader.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:10
The animation and controller is based 
on making the image moving around using javascript.

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:18
The concept is object-oriented. Creating for each images
and controlling them based on their current values.

4
00:00:19 --> 00:00:23
That is what I get from HTML5 Games.

5
00:00:24 --> 00:00:28
However, the trend of website nowaday is
about fitting in all kind of viewport.

6
00:00:29 --> 00:00:34
So, what if we can create different game mode
base on the size of your browser.

7
00:00:38 --> 00:00:52
You can play in limited-space mode.

8
00:00:55 --> 00:01:11
Shoot-through-gap mode.

9
00:01:13 --> 00:01:25
Or just really fast mode.

10
00:01:26 --> 00:01:31
The smaller the viewport, the faster the game.

11
00:01:38--> 00:01:47:
By using tools like grid, flexbox and
situational percentage calculation, this is the result.

12
00:01:49 --> 00:01:55
I have this idea when trying make the game
fit in different viewports.

13
00:01:57 --> 00:02:05
Still no mobile version though.

14
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
Sorry for the mismatch video sound

15
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
Thank you for watching.
